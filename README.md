## Projects <a name="dsprojects"></a>

### 1. üçî DeepChef <a name="deepchef"></a>

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone/blob/main/Deepchef.png?raw=true">

I created a recommender system on a dataset of over `520k` recipes `scraped` from [food.com](www.food.com) as my capstone project for the bootcamp -- titled **DeepChef**. DeepChef I harnesses the power of state-of-the-art large `language models` and `semantic embeddings` to create a `recommender system` that takes in users' favorite recipes -- ingredients or instructions, along with themes or other elements -- and returns the 5-most similar recipes from the dataset. To follow the most recent updates on DeepChef, check out [this repository](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone). 

I have also deployed the recommender system from Notebooks 5 and 6 into an online `interactive app` that can be accessed through this address: https://deepchef.streamlit.app.

In order to ensure the app is up and running on `Streamlit`'s website, I have deployed the recommender system only on 10% of the data that was originally curated for this purpose (see Notebook 6 of the project's repo). I hope to be able to scale the model in the near future.

### 2. <img src="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/New-Google-Logo.jpg" alt="SciPy Icon" width="28" height="29" /> Google|BrainStation Industry Hackathon <a name="Google"></a>

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="550" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/Google-Industry-Day/blob/main/Image.png">

Recently, I participated in a 24-hour `hackathon` hosted by **`Google`** and **`BrainStation`**, where we were asked to envision new ideas to educate users about `AI-powered` Google products while ensuring user trust and avoiding misunderstandings. Thanks to our amazing `team`, we were announced as the winner üèÜ of the contest. Our initial focus was to understand the key reasons behind the general population's mistrust in the use of AI. Through extensive research, we identified three significant factors contributing to this mistrust: the lack of `transparency`, concerns about `privacy` invasion, and the difficulty in establishing `ground truth` for evaluating AI algorithm results in products. Addressing these concerns is pivotal in building trust and confidence in AI technologies.

As a result, we introduced "Insights," a powerful `widget` integrated into the Google platform. Insights leverages the recent breakthrough in large language models to provide users with a unique glimpse behind the curtain, offering clear explanations of how AI enhances their experience, utilizes their data, and delivers the results they receive. With Insights, we aim to foster transparency and empower users to confidently embrace AI-related features. To learn more about Insights, check out the project's [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/amirkiaml/Google-Industry-Day).


### 3. üß† DeepAnalytic <a name="deepanalytic"></a>
DeepAnalytic is an end-to-end project dedicated to my research project on utilizing `LLMs` for various use cases in the context of `Analytic Philosophy`. A large amount of specialized philosophical data has been `scraped` from leading academic `journals`. Various cutting-edge `NLP` tasks will be performed on the collected data, for purposes of research.
<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="https://frogdesign.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04192430/AI_designing-with-data.gif">

The metadata of 28 `Springer Nature` philosophical journals has been scraped. This records the metadata of around `800k pages` of philosophical texts. The text data of other philosophical journals, from other publishers such as `Oxford University Press`, is also scraped. In particular, over `10k` pages of papers from the leading journal *`Analysis`*, alongside their metadata, are scraped.

Aside from the basic EDA and NLP analyses, various cutting-edge NLP tasks are scheduled to be performed on the scraped data in the near future. These tasks include:

- `Fine-tuning` a `sentence transformer` on the specialized text data to create domain-specific `vectorization`, which will be used for `topic modeling` and `semantic search` purposes,
- Creating philosophy-specific `Natural Language Inference` (`NLI`) datasets for `benchmarking`,
- `Question answering` on philosophical text data.

You can learn more about DeepAnalytic by checking out its dedicated repository, found [here](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepAnalytic).

### 4. üìö Book <a name="book"></a>

I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science*. The book has two parts. Part I explores the core mathematics at use in data science. It dives deep into the nitty-gritty of key subjects like `Linear Algebra`, `Calculus`, `Statistics` and `Probability Theory`. Part II builds upon the knowledge gained in the first part and explores the underlying mathematics of some of the well-known machine learning algorithms and models, such as `Regression`, `Tree Methods`, `Support Vector Machines`, `Clustering`, `PCA`, and `Neural Networks`. The book also provides sample codes to implement each of the `algorithms` in `Python`.

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="250" src="https://mathanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/book-cover-1-233x300-2.png">

The book is available on Amazon for purchase. Check out https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/ for more info and a sample chapter. I'm currently looking into writing the second volume of this book.

# üìà Data Analysis <a name="DA"></a>

For my data analysis projects, I have used most of the same tools listed for Data Science. Here are some of the projects that I have worked on. 

**NOTE:** Several of the following projects were carried out as part of BrainStation bootcamp, and I cannot share the source codes, visualizations, or reports with the public, as they can be reused by the next cohorts' students. If you're a recruiter or anyone else other than a current Data Science student at BrainStation, feel free to request a copy of the relevant files.

# Projects <a name="daprojects"></a>

## 1. Big Data Wrangling with Google Books Ngrams

The central aim of this project is to apply the skills and knowledge of `Big Data` to the Google `Ngrams` dataset, a remarkable creation by Google's research team. This dataset has been meticulously crafted through the analysis of content derived from Google Books, encompassing a vast repository that encapsulates around 4% of the entirety of printed books throughout history. This extensive collection spans across epochs, beginning in the 1800s and stretching into the 2000s. 

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="550" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/media/blob/main/ngrams.png">

The primary focus is on the proficient `loading`, `filtering`, and dynamic `visualization` of an expansive `real-world` dataset. This task will be carried out within the realm of a `cloud-based` distributed computing environment, making optimal use of prominent technologies including `Hadoop`, `Spark`, `Hive`, and the `S3 filesystem`, all of which are integral components of the process. A comprehensive and professionally structured `report` is provided at the end, encapsulating a concise overview of our findings.



## 2. Analysis of Culinary Patterns <a name="culinary"></a>
For my capstone project, DeepChef, I performed many data analysis tasks. 

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="550" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/media/blob/main/topics.png">

For the data analysis side of things, I embarked on an extensive exploration through `data wrangling`, `exploratory analysis`, `topic modeling`, `reporting`, and `presenting` the results. `Scraping` missing data from over 520,000 recipes rectified inaccuracies, while subsequent analysis unearthed ingredient trends, recipe categories, and factors driving ratings. Employing `Bertopic`, I `clustered` recipes to reveal underlying themes and presented visually striking topic distributions. Culminating in a comprehensive conclusion, I compiled an annotated `Jupyter notebook` detailing the methodology, insights, and journey from data exploration to `refined models`, showcasing a holistic and insightful narrative within the culinary data realm. 

- `Notebooks` ("Part 1" to "Part 4") can be found [here](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone).
- The final `written report` can be found [here](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone/blob/main/Final_Report.pdf).
- The final `oral presentation` can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/350eed0ce28c43e297ea78e6ede7d694).

  
## 3. Sentiment Analysis on Hotel Reviews <a name="sentiment"></a>
 This project involves analyzing hotel review data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project is divided into several steps, starting with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and progressing to data augmentation, modeling, and iterative improvements.

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="550" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/media/blob/main/words.png">

The project begins with sentiment `label transformation` and perceptive `visualization` of `sentiment score` distribution, identifying challenges. The road leads to `feature engineering`, encompassing non-numeric conversion, data partitioning, and `text vectorization`, creating a fusion of insights. Several ML algorithms (`Logistic regression`, `PCA`. `K-Nearest Neighbors` and `Decision Tree`) were used for sentiment prediction. Refinement ensued with cross-validation and a new feature introduction, enhancing accuracy and validation.


## 4. Predictive Analysis of West Nile Virus Spread <a name="virus"></a>

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a potentially serious viral illness transmitted primarily by mosquitoes. In the case of the city of Chicago, Illinois, where mosquito-borne diseases pose a significant public health concern, authorities have implemented a comprehensive strategy to track and understand the prevalence of WNV. By deploying a network of traps throughout the city, they collect mosquitoes and subsequently analyze the captured specimens to gain insights into the spread of the virus.

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="550" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/media/blob/main/virus.png">

This project starts by understanding and exploring the data. I uncovered patterns of mosquito counts over time, studied the prevalence of West Nile Virus (WNV) across mosquito species, and analyzed how mosquito counts varied by trap type. `Visual aids` helped present key takeaways clearly. Digging deeper, I computed average mosquito counts each month, compared WNV occurrence across species and dived into the `correlations` between different variables. I assessed the significance of these connections, grounding my insights in solid `statistics`. Moving forward, I developed models: a `linear regression` for predicting mosquito numbers and a `logistic regression` to understand WNV presence. My documentation wrapped it all up, revealing valuable mosquito behavior insights and shedding light on WNV transmission dynamics. I showcased connections uncovered through `rigorous analysis`, and how these models enriched our comprehension of mosquito counts and the elusive presence of WNV.


## 5. Trend Analysis and Visualization of Bixi Bike Usage <a name="bixi"></a>
BIXI Montreal (hereafter: Bixi), established in 2014 by the city of Montreal, is a non-profit organization responsible for overseeing the bike-sharing system. As of 2023, Bixi owns 10,000 bikes that can be accessed through nearly 800 stations. Our goal is to gain a high-level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations, and overall business growth. The data used for this project is focused on April-November 2016 and
2017.

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="550" src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/media/blob/main/Bixi.png">


In this project, I seamlessly blended essential skills to conduct in-depth data analysis, harness interactive `Tableau visualizations`, and demonstrate proficient `SQL querying`. This dynamic trio formed the backbone of a thorough `exploratory analysis` of Bixi bike usage data. Through adept SQL utilization, I efficiently extracted, transformed, and prepared raw data for analysis, ensuring its conversion into valuable insights.

Central to the project was the creation of an impactful visualization dashboard, designed meticulously to serve as a visually captivating and interactive platform for data exploration. The dashboard's unique feature of drill-down capabilities empowered users to navigate deeper into nuances of Bixi bike usage, unearthing hidden patterns and `trends` that evade casual observation.

The culmination of my work found its expression in `professional documentation`, expertly merging the `analytical rigor` of data exploration with the communicative prowess of visualizations. These findings were translated into `actionable recommendations` through clear explanations complemented by visually engaging charts and graphs. This documentation, bridging the gap between technical insights and pragmatic decision-making, catered comprehensively to `diverse stakeholders`.


# üìú Social and Philosophical Aspects of Data  <a name="Social"></a>
Aside from technical skills and projects in the data space, I regularly engage with less social, philosophical, and ethical sides of it too.
