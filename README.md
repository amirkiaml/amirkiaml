# üåü Introduction 
Hi there! Amir here, a data scientist with an academic background in math and philosophy. I love all things data but particularly find Natural language Processing (NLP) very fascinating. On the philosophical side of things, I like diving deep into questions of machine consciousness, social impact tech, AI safety, and IT ethics.

üìù[Academic CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITlkwcnUVF85qjkpPhkJ4s8CWt6H3TVl/view?usp=sharing)

## Undergraduate
  
I did my undergraduate in **Mathematics and Applications** at *Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)* in Iran. While my focus and final thesis was on mathematical logics, I had deep exposure to various pure and applied mathematics subjects, mostly in terms of coursework. 

![image](https://www.inria.fr/sites/default/files/2023-04/math-work-1826x1027.jpg)

### Coursework
Among these are the following topics, for each one or more courses taken:
- Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Abstract Algebra
- Calculus, Real Analysis and Complex Analysis
- Differential Equations
- Euclidean, Differential, Manifold and Algebraic Geometry
- Logic, Set Theory, Model Theory and Category Theory

### Research
My thesis was on an advanced topic in the crossovers of category theory and modal logics: coalgebraic logics. My thesis, titled *Logics for Coalgebras, and a Final Coalgebra Theorem* (written in Persian) can be found [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Logics-For-Coalgebras-and-a-Final-Coalgebra-Theorem.pdf).

### Skills
Some major skills that I acquired during my bachelor's program were as follows:

- `perseverance` and `responsibility`
- `analytical thinking`
- `quantitative reasoning`

My mathematics background has always nourished my life, in our outside of academia. My master's and PhD degrees both built on top of this foundation and incorporated cutting-edge mathematical techniques in my research -- I will say more about these below. As for my data science endeavors, I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science* -- which is available on Amazon for purchasing (see [here](https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/) for links). I also own and run a blog on the same subject: [mathanddata.com](https://mathanddata.com).



## Master's Degree
  
After years of exposure to various kinds of mathematical logic in my undergraduate years, I grew interested in the philosophical ideas behind math and logic. I decided to do my MA in Philosophy. I applied for the MA program in Philosophy at Tartu University in Estonia and was awarded several scholarships to pursue my dreams for a period of two years. 

![image](https://www.pnas.org/cms/10.1073/pnas.1900357116/asset/160b7a72-ac79-4d4e-9b23-5e0de6b5b75f/assets/graphic/pnas.1900357116fig02.jpeg)

### Coursework
The program was research-intensive, but some of the courses that I took:

- Philosophy of AI
- Philosophy of Language
- Linguistic Semantics
- Philosophy of Mind
- Animal Consciousness
- Epistemology
- Metaphysics

### Teaching
I had a chance to teach a graduate-level logic [course](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Course-Description.pdf), focused on modern modal logics and their semantics, to over 10 masters and PhD students from various disciplines (philosophy, mathematics and semiotics). 

### Research
In my MA thesis, titled *Perception, Abductive Methodology, and Compositional Universalism*, I proposed a few arguments for a major argument in metaphysics -- *compositional universalism* -- according to which any plurality of objects constitutes an object. You can find my MA thesis [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/MA-Thesis.pdf).

I was the only MA student to collaborate with 6 philosophers in a highly sought-after [research project](https://philexpertise.weebly.com/people.html) on the nature of controversy in philosophical debates, leading to several high-impact publications in leading journals.

### Awards
During my MA program, I was awarded several scholarships, worth over $24,000; some of them are as follows:

- The *Best MA Thesis Prospectus of The Year* Award, Department of Philosophy, University of Tartu 2018
- *Tuition Waiver* Scholarship, University of Tartu (CA$6300/Year) 2017 & 2018
- *DoraPlus* Scholarship, University of Tartu (CA$5700/Year) 2017 & 2018
- *Achievement Stipend*, University of Tartu 2018
- *Excellence Scholarship* for Travel and Accommodation, University of Tartu

### Skills
Among others, the main skills that I obtained or improved upon during my MA studies include:
- `analytical thinking`
- `research`
- `communication`

## PhD
  
After I successfully finished my MA program in Philosophy, I decided to continue exploring the frontiers of philosophical thinking by pursuing a PhD in the field. Throughout the 4 years of my studies at the University of Calgary, I had the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research in Logic and Metaphysics.

### Research

During my PhD, my research particularly focused on questions of fundamentality and how we can harness advanced mathematical and logical tools to address them. My secondary research interest, which I'm still using in my current efforts, has to do with IT Ethics, AI safety, and machine consciousness. My dissertation can be found [here](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/items/5e063fbe-91e5-4932-88f8-16423030d5e3). One of the chapters of my dissertation was recently [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04114-5) in a leading journal in the field. For my other papers and manuscripts, check out [here](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/amirhossein-kiani).


### Teaching
During my PhD, I also had a chance to learn and teach hundreds of students, as the main instructor or in collaboration with others, a diverse range of material on philosophical and ethical questions associated with AI, IT and Data. This has now contributed to my better understanding of recent debates on AI safety and various ethical concern around the topic. I'm currently running a [Medium blog](https://philanddata.medium.com/) that is focused on these topics. I also sometimes write voluntary content on the subject for non-for-profit organizations such as the [Centre for Social Impact Technology](https://centreforsocialimpacttech.ca/); see [here](https://centreforsocialimpacttech.ca/2023/04/13/data-citizenship-at-large-and-in-alberta/?fbclid=IwAR2wYqHlgJ_4It3ZW0JL_zVe_qr7n4OmSqDXOQ5mUvbJ_jdI6eO-s5Ku6bk) as a sample.

### Awards
During my PhD, I was awarded several prestigious scholarships, worth over $50,000; some of them are as follows:
- Alberta Graduate Excellence Scholarship (AGES) - International (CA$15000) 2021
- Department of Philosophy Graduate Essay Award (CA$2500) 2021
- Alberta Graduate Excellence Scholarship (AGES) - International (CA$15000) 2019
- Full Funding Package (4 years) - CA$30000/Year 2019-2023

### Skills

Some of the major skills that I have acquired and reinforced throughout my PhD are as follows, all at very advanced levels: 
- `analytical thinking`
- `research`
- `communication`
- `team-working`
- `mentoring`
- `time management`
- `project management`

## ü§ñ Projects

### 1. üçî DeepChef

I created a recommender system on a dataset of over 520k recipes scraped from [food.com](www.food.com) as my capstone project for the bootcamp -- titled **DeepChef**. DeepChef I harnesses the power of state-of-the-art large langue models and semantic embeddings to create a recommender system that takes in users' favorite recipes -- ingredients or instructions, along with themes or other elements -- and returns the 5-most similar recipes from the dataset. To follow the most recent updates on DeepChef, check out [this repository](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone). 

I have also deployed the recommender system from Notebooks 5 and 6 into an online interactive app that can be accessed through this address: https://deepchef.streamlit.app.

<img src="https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone/blob/main/Deepchef.png?raw=true" alt="SciPy Icon" width="350" height="400" />

In order to assure the app is up and running on Streamlit's website, I have deployed the recommender system only on 10% of the data that was originally curated for this purpose (see Notebook 6 of the project's repo). I hope to be able to scale the model in the near future.

### 2. <img src="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/New-Google-Logo.jpg" alt="SciPy Icon" width="28" height="29" /> Google|BrainStation Industry Project

Recently, I participated in a 24-hour hackathon hosted by **Google** and **BrainStation**, where we were asked to envision new ideas to educate users about AI-powered Google products while ensuring user trust and avoiding misunderstandings. Thanks to our amazing team, we were announced as the winner üèÜ of the contest. Our initial focus was to understand the key reasons behind the general population's mistrust in the use of AI. Through extensive research, we identified three significant factors contributing to this mistrust: the lack of transparency, concerns about privacy invasion, and the difficulty in establishing ground truth for evaluating AI algorithm results in products. Addressing these concerns is pivotal in building trust and confidence in AI technologies.

As a result, we introduced "Insights," a powerful widget integrated into the Google platform. "Insights" leverages the recent breakthrough in large language models to provide users with a unique glimpse behind the curtain, offering clear explanations of how AI enhances their experience, utilizes their data, and delivers the results they receive. With "Insights," we aim to foster transparency and empower users to confidently embrace AI-related features. To learn more about "Insights," check out the project's [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/amirkiaml/Google-Industry-Day).

### 3. üß† DeepAnalytic
DeepAnalytic is an end-to-end project dedicated to my research project on utilizing LLMs for various use cases in the context of Analytic Philosophy. A large amount of specialized philosophical data has been scraped from leading academic journals. Various cutting-edge NLP tasks will be performed on the collected data, for purposes of research. At the moment, this project is on hold and will be resumed soon after my bootcamps ends, around early August.

The metadata of 28 Springer Nature philosophical journals has been scraped. This records the metadata of around 800k pages of philosophical texts. The text data of other philosophical journals, from other publishers such as Oxford University Press, is also scraped. In particular, over 10k pages of papers from the leading journal *Analysis*, alongside their metadata, are scraped.

Aside from the basic EDA and NLP analyses, various cutting-edge NLP tasks are scheduled to be performed on the scraped data in the near future. These tasks include:
- Fine-tuning a sentence transformer on the specialized text data to create domain-specific vectorization, which will be used for topic modeling and semantic search purposes,
- Creating philosophy-specific Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets for benchmarking,
- Question answering on philosophical text data.

You can learn more about DeepAnalytic by checking out its dedicated repository, found [here](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepAnalytic).

### 4. üìö Book 

I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science*. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
